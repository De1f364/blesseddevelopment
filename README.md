# BLESSED_dev
Where the good things happen.

**-=WHAT WE DO HERE=-**

This is a nice and clean way to collaborate on regular @justforlulz development all of us can be proud of.

Just clone the rep and create subfolders according to your projects within existing structure.

The repository is loved and maintained with honor.

**-=TO CLONE THE REP & BRANCH=-**
```
git clone https://github.com/ch3rrydrunk/blesseddevelopment *dir_name* && cd *dir_name*
git branch *branch_name*       // name can be anything
git checkout *branch_name*	   // you can switch back
echo KAEF					   // with git checkout master (git checkout --help for more)
```

**-=TO UPDATE THE OTHERS CHANGES IN THE REP=-**
```
git fetch && git pull https://github.com/ch3rrydrunk/blesseddevelopment && echo KAEF
```
Simple as that! Then just continue working as usual with "add-commit-push" as needed.
Remember, you are now pushing to the new branch, you just created.

**-=TO SUBMIT YOUR BRANCH TO THE MASTER=-**
```
git fetch && git pull          // this will update the info on the master on your local machine 
git checkout *your_branch_name*
git pull --set-upstream https://github.com/ch3rrydrunk/BASED_BOIS_BASE.git // after it
> *git will ask your Git Hub login and password here*					   // u will be able to just push and pull
echo KAEF
```

Rep owner will be able to see your branch and then will be able to merge your changes.
Your branch will also be seen in "BRANCHES" section on GitHub
